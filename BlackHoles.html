            <h2>About Black Holes</h2>
            <p>Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. They form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles. Black holes vary in size and type, and their existence gives us insights into the nature of gravity and the limits of space and time.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Black Holes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes</strong>: These black holes form when massive stars undergo supernova explosions. They are typically several times the mass of the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes</strong>: Found at the centers of galaxies, these black holes are millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun. An example is the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A*.</li>
                <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes</strong>: These black holes are thought to be an intermediate stage between stellar and supermassive black holes, with masses ranging from hundreds to thousands of solar masses.</li>
                <li><strong>Primordial Black Holes</strong>: Hypothetical black holes that may have formed soon after the Big Bang. They are theorized to be very small, possibly microscopic, and could reveal information about the early universe.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Interesting Facts About Black Holes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event Horizon</strong>: The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape. It is often referred to as the 'point of no return.'</li>
                <li><strong>Hawking Radiation</strong>: A theoretical prediction by physicist Stephen Hawking that black holes can emit radiation and eventually evaporate over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Spaghettification</strong>: The process by which objects are stretched and torn apart by intense gravitational forces when they approach a black hole.</li>
