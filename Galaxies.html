            <h2>About Galaxies and Constellations</h2>
            <p>Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, held together by gravity. They come in various shapes and sizes, such as spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies. Constellations, on the other hand, are patterns of stars as seen from Earth and are often named after mythological figures, animals, or objects. Together, galaxies and constellations form a breathtaking tapestry in the night sky, providing both beauty and clues about the structure of our universe.</p>
