            <h2>About Stars</h2>
            <p>Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity. They emit light and heat through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms merge to form helium. Stars vary in size, color, and brightness, depending on their age, temperature, and composition. They range from small, dim red dwarfs to large, bright blue supergiants, creating a stunning display in the night sky.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Stars:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red Dwarfs</strong>: Small, cool, and long-lived stars that make up the majority of stars in our galaxy.</li>
                <li><strong>Giants and Supergiants</strong>: Very large stars, often brightly colored, with shorter lifespans than smaller stars.</li>
                <li><strong>White Dwarfs</strong>: The remnants of stars that have exhausted their fuel and are slowly cooling over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutron Stars</strong>: Extremely dense remnants of massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions.</li>
            </ul>
